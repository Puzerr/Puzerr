## Hello, my friend! 🐼 

### > 🙋‍♂️ Who am I?
My name is Raphael Ferraz. I am a 21 years old technology and computer lover who are trying to learn something new every day.

Some other things I like to do:
- Walk throught the city with someone I like by my side;
- Play video games and laugth a lot with my friends on Discord;
- Go to car events every time I can;
- Any nerd/geek/technology event as well;
- Have a nice cold beer in a tiring friday, after a long busy week;
- And some physical exercises to keep a good mental health.

### > 🎓 College
By now? I do '*Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas*' (software development) at Instituto de Ensino Superior de Brasília.  
I am currently in the third (almost fourth) semester out of five.

### > 📌 Where am I from?

### > 🗣️ Languages
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese: I am a native brazilian portuguese speaker, that's it;
- 🇺🇸 English: My english is not thaaat bad. I can understand a casual conversation easyly. But I find it hard to talk about a specific topic keeping a smooth speech. It is a working in progress though.

### > 💻 Thing I know how to do
I choosed the dark side of the force (backend). To be honest, I do not find working with divs, css and these things appetizing. My pleasure, at certain point, is building API's and stare at giant red error screen for hours, and that is ✨ *fascinating* ✨  
Take a look at what I have studied by now:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- Bootstrap;
- Node.js;
- Express.js;
- Mongoose.js;
- MongoDB;
- SQL (w/ MySQL).

There are other things, like requirement analysis and some statistic analysis.

### > 🔓 Open to work!
While I am still in college, I am looking for an internship oportunity (estágio). That way I can practice what I learned in a real professional environment.
